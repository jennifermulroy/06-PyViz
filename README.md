I created a [Dashboard](http://localhost:5006/dashboard) analyzing real estate trends in the San Francisco market. Below are snapshots of each tab in the dashboard. The last tab is interactive with parallel charts of the top ten most expensive neighborhoods to allow users the ability to compare or assess relationships and trends in the market.
